My own photography website - first Milestone Project -
It includes my own photos to show to the user. The user could get in contact with me by a contact form.
I have tried to be as simple as possible using HTML and CSS.

The website fulfills this need with four pages:

home.html
The home shows a big fullsize background picture of NY and a little summary of what i do.

portfolio.html
I uploaded 4 pictures on this page. Before i did that the pictures were too big and i made the size mb smaller bij Paint and then uploaded them. 
It shows the user the different pictures and the possibilities when contacting me for a project.

equipment.html
This page shows the user the camera i use and which techniques.

contact.html
This page shows the user the contactdetails and the contactform.

I have tested the website on the desktop, several different smartphones and a tablet. I showed the website to friends and family and ask them to use and try it.
