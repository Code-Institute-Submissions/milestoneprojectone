FIRST MILESTONE PROJECT

Author: Bas van Hoolwerff Date: 31/07/2018 project: My own photography website.

Introduction: This is my first milestone project for the user centric front-end development module. I have decided to create my own project using the materials provided by Code Institute. I have used Bootstrap 3 to help make the website responsive with all screen sizes and also to take a mobile-first approach.

It is one single page with different sections allowing the user to navigate the site at ease.

It includes my own photos to show to the user. The user could get in contact with me by a contact form.
I have tried to be as clean as possible using HTML, CSS, my own images and Bootstrap.

The website fulfills the needs with four pages:

home.html
The home shows a big fullsize background picture of NY and a little summary of what i do. The picture is made by myself when i was in NY. I am really design and UX orientated so that's why i kept it clean and easy to watch for the user.

portfolio.html
I uploaded 4 pictures of my own on this page. Before i did that the pictures were too big and i made the size mb smaller bij Paint and then uploaded them. 
It shows the user the different pictures and the possibilities when contacting me for a project like nightpictures, diafragma and so on. It is a small portfolio.

equipment.html
This page shows the user the camera i use and which techniques it has.

contact.html
This page shows the user the contactdetails and the contactform. When the user presses 'send request' i have made another section where it says 'is under construction'.
The user can go back to the normal site with the 'home' button on top of the screen.

I have tested the website on the desktop, several different smartphones and a tablet. I showed the website to friends and family and ask them to use and try it. They all sais the UX is really nice, easy to use and the information is clear.

Functionality / Technologies
General
The site links to Bootstrap 3.3.7 and makes use of its form styling and grid system.

The site links to Bootstrap Fontawesome 4.7.0.

The site links to Cloudfare.

My own further styling has been done within css/styles.css

The project has been written in cloud9 and committed to git at each stage of functionality.

The site is now live at https://codingbas.github.io/milestoneprojectone/index.html

Hope you enjoy my very first website! And thanks for reading :).
