This is my first website webbased only. It's a one page with a scroll down.
It includes my own photos to show to the user. The user could get in contact with me.
I have tried to be as simple as possible using HTML and CSS.
I uploaded 5 pictures. Before i did that the pictures were too big and i made the size mb smaller bij Paint and then uploaded them.

The functionality is simple: information for the user and the possibility to get in contact with me.

My boss from the IT company i work for put some JS in the code, but it was just to show me what JS is.

I have tested the website on the desktop, several different smartphones and a tablet. I showed the website to friends and family and ask them to use and try it.
